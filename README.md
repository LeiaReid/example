## Mental health and child mobility, in education

Every year the number of students struggling with mental health has risen. It has almost doubled since the beginning of austerity. But welsh teachers and students report a lack of support, and an inability to access services. 

Four in five teachers Teachers have warned of a growing “crisis” in pupil mental health, with over 80% saying the problems have worsened in the last two years.
 
Less than half of the 8,000 teachers, school leaders and support staff surveyed by the National Education Union reported having a school counsellor, a third reported access to specialist support and less than a third said they had a dedicated school nurse.
 
The survey showed that 81% of primary teachers and 86% of secondary teachers reported an increase in the number of pupil mental health problems in the last two years, with respondents warning it had reached “crisis point”.
 
The NHS data on Mental Health of Children and Young People in England, revealed that one in eight school-age children had an identified mental health disorder last year, while five per cent met the criteria for two or more disorders when interviewed.

According to the collection treatment has risen year on year. Anxiety and emotional disorders have required the most attention, followed by behavioural, hyperactivity, depressive and other conditions. 
 
A year before the NHS collection, in 2017, Ministers announced plans to spend more than £300 million on new mental health leads in schools and support teams to link education and health services. But, MPs, unions, headteachers, teachers, health and lifestyle experts all say this funding will not help to plug the problem.
 
This January, the government admitted that it might take a decade for the increased mental health support to reach all schools.
 
In April, the Children’s Commissioner published a report looking at the amount spent on “low-level” mental health support for children in England. It revealed local areas, which included both local authorities and NHS spending, allocated a total of £226 million for low-level mental health services in 2018/19, just over £14 per child.
 
The total reported spend on low-level  mental health services across all areas in England increased by 17% between 2016/17 and 2018/19 in real terms, over a third of areas in England had a real-terms spending, nearly 60% of local authorities seen a real-term fall.
 
The report also illustrates how spending has fallen, in-line with reduced spending by local authorities. In 2018/19 spending per child was higher in London, and the North East, but lower in the East Midlands, the East of England and the South East.
 
In London, local authority spending per child was £17.88, in the East of England, only £5.32 was allocated per child.
 
“This report reveals for the first time the postcode lottery facing the increasing number of children suffering from low-level mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. It is extremely worrying that a third of local areas in England are actually reducing real terms spending on these vital services.” said Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, in a press release, commenting on its report, “The NHS Ten Year Plan has made children’s mental health a top priority, but it won’t succeed unless children with low-level mental health problems are offered help quickly and early. Local authorities are under huge financial pressure and many are doing a good job, but those who are spending barely anything on low-level mental health cannot continue to leave children to struggle alone.”

Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary at the NEU, said on its website, in a press release, regarding mental health funding, government education policies are, “contributing to a terrible and destructive situation for young people and the education workforce.”
 
“Schools can’t solve this alone and the government’s underfunding of public services is damaging the next generation from an early age,” he said, “Above all this is about pupils, and it is incumbent upon the education system to do all it can to support anyone with mental health problems.”
 
A spokesperson for the Department for Education, said children’s mental health was a “key priority” and the new compulsory health education curriculum will ensure children are taught “how to look after their mental wellbeing and recognise when classmates are struggling.”
 
“We are investing more in mental health support – with an additional £2.3bn a year being spent by 2023-24. This means that by 2023-24 an extra 345,000 children and young people up the age of 25 will benefit from a range of services, including new support teams that will provide additional trained staff to work directly with schools and colleges.”

In an average school class of 30 young people, typically three will have a diagnosable mental illness – but the true prevalence of mental illness is estimated to be significantly higher.

There’s currently no requirement for schools to have separate mental health policies. From the sample of 90 mainstream schools, by a Department for education investigation, only two primary schools and two secondary schools provided focussed policies on the mental health of pupils. 

Whilst very few schools provided mental health policies, at least 25/45 (56%) primary schools and 20/45 (44%) secondary schools were providing some form of mental health support. Mental health support provided by schools, shown in their policies, was either targeted support for pupils displaying emotional and behavioural difficulties (12 primary and 6 secondary), universal support to promote pupils’ self-esteem and resilience (8 primary and 9 secondary), or a combination (5 primary and 5 secondary). 

“It’s not a priority in our school. We help when we can intervene, but services can only help so many, our pupils can expect a three month wait.” said an anonymous head teacher as the Welsh NUT conference in March, “We’d love to adapt it into the curriculum, but we don’t have money.”

Another NUT headteacher, said “One of my schools is in a pretty deprived area. Children are coming in with issues from home, mental health issues more and more these days, but we haven’t got the staff to help to support those children. We haven’t got the money too train the staff we have to go on courses and stuff to help. So it is [education funding](https://leiareid.github.io/funding) affecting certainly how we can help children.”

In a discussion, primary head teachers stated, “We are seeing more and more children suffering as primary school heads.”

The promotion of healthy mental health habits is vital in childhood. “Children also pick up on things as they grow, so in the same way you would be concerned about them picking up a swear word, you should also be aware of the words you use, how much attention you pay to them and what you do when you reach your limits with them. How you behave will in turn reflect the way they behave.” said life coach Puja K. McClymont, and entrepreneur of Frankly Coaching, “Having time dedicated to developing mental health and improving any challenges through monthly counsellor visits etc will also allow for parents and teachers to be able to monitor and track a child’s development and therefore both parties are more able to manage any challenges that occur a lot sooner.”

She cited the new mindfulness curriculum, as a positive step towards better mental health: “Other activities such as Mindfulness - which has this year been added to the curriculum in UK schools, Yoga and community activities (giving back) will all contribute to better mental health can be done both at home and in school."

Young people’s attitudes towards mental health, covered in the same NHS survey, identified that children and young people are still struggling to seek diagnosis, treatment and build a reliable support network.
